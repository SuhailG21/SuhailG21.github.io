            <p>(NSFAS, the National Student Financial Aid Scheme is yet another South African government financial support scheme for assisting potential learners in achieving their academic goals. NSFAS was established in 1991 with
                this vision and has been there playing an indisputable role by carrying out its financial support programs ever since. The organization has been empowering South Africa socially and economically by improving its funding schemes with new initiatives each year.
                NSFAS primarily aims at facilitating South African learners who demonstrate a financial need or physical disability and wish to pursue undergraduate and postgraduate studies at a South African public university or Technical and Vocational Education and Training
                (TVET) college., It truly supports the vision that every learner should have equal access to tertiary education despite their adverse financial or physical conditions.)</p></div>

            <p>(Crypto wallets keep your private keys – the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies – safe and accessible, allowing you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets like Ledger (which looks like a USB stick) to mobile apps like Coinbase Wallet, which makes using crypto as easy as shopping with a credit card online.)</p></div>

            Cognos Analytics uses AI to uncover patterns in your data you didn’t know were there, and natural language generation to communicate those insights to you, so you can spend less time preparing your data and more time analysing and making decisions on what to do next.
            IBM Cognos Analytics connects to a wide variety of data sources including direct connections and flat files and is available on IBM’s Cloud, hosted in your own Cloud, or on premise.)</p></div>
